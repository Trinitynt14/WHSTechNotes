we couldn't do anything yesterday. today we did journal prompt and drone.

journal prompt I've worked with python before but I like how versatile the language is. we can use it with the cars drones, or even just letters on the screen.

I think the explanations were fine. maybe some people need a walk through. I didn't have any problems but mainly because I did the same. e thing last year.

Free write! anyway, this week I plan on continuing the code I've been doing on code hs. It's a silly game.

It's important because python has strict rules to follow wihtin the guides. So if you spell something wrong or put something in the wrong place it can mess up the whole codes.

I decided to do game developer.They transfer game concepts into actual games. It depends on the game but typically they need progamming obviously, problem solvong skills,teamwork skills, time manegment,among others. In order to do this you need to have atleast a bachelors in software engineering or another related field. You can grow in communicating and programming skills. along with animation if the game calls for it. I like making games so this would be fun to do.
