journal prompt I've worked with python before but I like how versatile the language is. we can use it with the cars drones, or even just letters on the screen.

I think the explanations were fine. maybe some people need a walk through. I didn't have any problems but mainly because I did the same. e thing last year.

Free write! anyway, this week I plan on continuing the code I've been doing on code hs. It's a silly game.

It's important because python has strict rules to follow wihtin the guides. So if you spell something wrong or put something in the wrong place it can mess up the whole codes.

I decided to do game developer.They transfer game concepts into actual games. It depends on the game but typically they need progamming obviously, problem solvong skills,teamwork skills, time manegment,among others. In order to do this you need to have atleast a bachelors in software engineering or another related field. You can grow in communicating and programming skills. along with animation if the game calls for it. I like making games so this would be fun to do.

For coding when something goes wrong you usually have to wrack your brain for a solution therefore problem solving. A lot of these companies use coding to keep information and stuff so that's one way to understand. The amount of things you can make with code or program definatly enhances creativity.

I think ai would be great for solving problem. like showing you steps by steps or suggesting fixes. It would be great. that is until it gives you the wrong answer or even wrong way the solve the steps. Or it straight up cant help.
