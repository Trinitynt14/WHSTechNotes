Created my github journal and helped program drones
# August 28, 2024 
programmed drone to fly around.
# September 4, 2024 
we couldn't do anything yesterday. today we did journal prompt and drone. 
# September 4, 2024
journal prompt I've worked with python before but I like how versatile the language is. we can use it with the cars drones, or even just letters on the screen.

I think the explanations were fine. maybe some people need a walk through. I didn't have any problems but mainly because I did the same. e thing last year. 
# September 17, 2024
Free write! anyway, this week I plan on continuing the code I've been doing on code hs. It's a silly game.
# september 24, 2024
It's important because python has strict rules to follow wihtin the guides. So if you spell something wrong or put something in the wrong place it can mess up the whole codes.

I use social media a lot and i read online. Those things require computer science to even be made.

I decided to do game developer.They transfer game concepts into actual games. It depends on the game but typically they need progamming obviously, problem solvong skills,teamwork skills, time manegment,among others. In order to do this you need to have atleast a bachelors in software engineering or another related field. You can grow in communicating and programming skills. along with animation if the game calls for it. I like making games so this would be fun to do.

For coding when something goes wrong you usually have to wrack your brain for a solution therefore problem solving. A lot of these companies use coding to keep information and stuff so that's one way to understand. The amount of things you can make with code or program definatly enhances creativity.
# october 25, 2024
I think ai would be great for solving problem. like showing you steps by steps or suggesting fixes. It would be great. that is until it gives you the wrong answer or even wrong way the solve the steps. Or it straight up cant help.

I think when it comes to voting counting the ballets would definently be something a program can do. of course the machines can always miscount or be hacked but it would be a helpful program

I think it's because you never really know who can see what you publish. It can put you in danger unintetionally.You can always use vpns or use secure networks or sites.oh yeah i defintially have. I accidently unintentially posted what school I go to so now i always double check my post.You can always just limit what information i give out.
# november 12, 2024
A current event happening right now is the election. There's a lot going on that I think require problem solving skills. Like they're recounting some balets because things burned down and votes weren't counted.I think it'd be good if they stored this data in a cloud like automatically or something that way if things like this happen it wouldnt take so long to count lost votes.

I think it def makes packaging fatser to get food out faster and it makes food better and could keep it fresher for longer. I think it's bad to rely on because if somethin gbreals we could be doomed or if something were to fall into the machine without knowledge you're also cooked.
# december 2, 2024
Ai has been updated to discover and realize different audios images and videos. I think this is pretty cool because you can now analyze these things on a different level. I can just imagine how it improves police investigation.

Brain rot to me are just words that are very popular for dumb reasons and they just affect everyones brain. Honestly media doesnt make me feel bad or good I just kind of doomscroll. If anything I guess negative depending on what I find. Slop is one I don't hear often but lore is one I see a lot. I use lore myself a bunch too. No, no matter what you do or where you are on media you'll find brainrot. it's called brainwhat because it infects you.

Im so excited for winter break. I love sitting in bed doing nothing and thinking about nothing.
# january 8, 2025
I enjoy the freedom we have in class when it comes to creating code. especially if I don't want to some days then I can take a brain break. I don't really know I think I wanna dive more in images in code for my personal projects. I'm not really interested in certifications since I'm not pursuing computer science after high school. 
# january 13, 2025
the shift is pretty bad. tech is already a pretty competitive field and adding ai to the mix doesn't not make this better. I think ai can help find problems in code or something but other than that ai can be really strict with limits making it hard to use. gotta find a job that's good and ready for me. 
# january 22, 2025
I think the government being able to interact with the users apps can negativly impact techonology. People feel like their favorite apps could just be taken at any moment. Well even though tiktok showd what they could I think you can just show that this imformation is being put back to the user and not stored anywhere else. I would instead update terms and agreements and make them acceptable again in order to ensure app safety instead. I need to make people more aware of the data my app is collecting and where it goes into the app/code.

I think technology could be used to double check safety factors like making sure engines are working properly for example. I think it could also help tripple checking code for take off. With air traffic control systems if you use a sensor it's easy to tell if a collision or something similar is going to happen.
If you have a weak system hacking or taking it over is also really easy. It's best to have a strong system that can constantly search for bugs so it can't be compromised or otherwise.

I learned that the multiple for staff is staves. I was watching this series i like and they reffered to a bunch of staffs as staves and i googled it to find out what it means.

I think technology could help make that connection between eachother. Taking an analysis on commonly used slang terms by analysing videos or something else could work. The benefits is having an understanding of something if it's or bad. Like if something is a threat for an investigation. But at the same time it's weird having the other adults using our slang. Most may not like it.

I don't schools need to learn slang. It just wouldn't benefit them atleast now. Kids use slang just to shorten words or due to pop culture so there's no need to do so on less you really wanna understand some of it. Some of the slang we say could have an opposite reaction. I know when I use slang most of the time my parents think it's bad but most of the time it's not. So it's just a miscommunication if they dont understand.

For the most part I was scrolling on social media the whole time. I was just entertained since I couldn't do much else. My app was crushing a bunch (I need to update it) so app functionalty maybe.

Something else I used was my computer. For the most part I used it to play games but I also started writing stories in it aswell. The games could relate to coding and app development.

When it come to techonology for this march madness I think its helpful. The ai or statistics you use are a very good way to make an accurate guess. It's a helpful way to get your information and process it at a fast pace.
