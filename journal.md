Created my github journal and helped program drones
# August 28, 2024 
programmed drone to fly around.
# September 4, 2024 
we couldn't do anything yesterday. today we did journal prompt and drone. 
# September 4, 2024
journal prompt I've worked with python before but I like how versatile the language is. we can use it with the cars drones, or even just letters on the screen.

I think the explanations were fine. maybe some people need a walk through. I didn't have any problems but mainly because I did the same. e thing last year.

Free write! anyway, this week I plan on continuing the code I've been doing on code hs. It's a silly game.

It's important because python has strict rules to follow wihtin the guides. So if you spell something wrong or put something in the wrong place it can mess up the whole codes.

I use social media a lot and i read online. Those things require computer science to even be made.

I decided to do game developer.They transfer game concepts into actual games. It depends on the game but typically they need progamming obviously, problem solvong skills,teamwork skills, time manegment,among others. In order to do this you need to have atleast a bachelors in software engineering or another related field. You can grow in communicating and programming skills. along with animation if the game calls for it. I like making games so this would be fun to do.

For coding when something goes wrong you usually have to wrack your brain for a solution therefore problem solving. A lot of these companies use coding to keep information and stuff so that's one way to understand. The amount of things you can make with code or program definatly enhances creativity.

I think ai would be great for solving problem. like showing you steps by steps or suggesting fixes. It would be great. that is until it gives you the wrong answer or even wrong way the solve the steps. Or it straight up cant help.

I think when it comes to voting counting the ballets would definently be something a program can do. of course the machines can always miscount or be hacked but it would be a helpful program

I think it's because you never really know who can see what you publish. It can put you in danger unintetionally.You can always use vpns or use secure networks or sites.oh yeah i defintially have. I accidently unintentially posted what school I go to so now i always double check my post.You can always just limit what information i give out.

A current event happening right now is the election. There's a lot going on that I think require problem solving skills. Like they're recounting some balets because things burned down and votes weren't counted.I think it'd be good if they stored this data in a cloud like automatically or something that way if things like this happen it wouldnt take so long to count lost votes.

I think it def makes packaging fatser to get food out faster and it makes food better and could keep it fresher for longer. I think it's bad to rely on because if somethin gbreals we could be doomed or if something were to fall into the machine without knowledge you're also cooked.

Ai has been updated to discover and realize different audios images and videos. I think this is pretty cool because you can now analyze these things on a different level. I can just imagine how it improves police investigation.

Brain rot to me are just words that are very popular for dumb reasons and they just affect everyones brain. Honestly media doesnt make me feel bad or good I just kind of doomscroll. If anything I guess negative depending on what I find. Slop is one I don't hear often but lore is one I see a lot. I use lore myself a bunch too. No, no matter what you do or where you are on media you'll find brainrot. it's called brainwhat because it infects you.
